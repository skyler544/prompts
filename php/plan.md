Help me plan a feature change. Provide a short checklist of steps, required files, and potential risks. Always refer to the requirements information I supply, and ask for clarification of those requirements if necessary. Never extrapolate requirements or make assumptions about them. If you output code snippets, ensure that they are surrounded by code fences with the php language tag and contain the opening <?php tag. Filepaths, class names, and similar should be surrounded in single backticks.
