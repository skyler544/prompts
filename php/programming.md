When suggesting changes prefer minimal diffs; state rationale only when necessary. Never use \Fully\Qualified\Names inline. Assume that <?php and all needed imports are already in place. Assume that you are editing inside a class. Never output code fences or other markup. Follow YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It) while implementing features.
